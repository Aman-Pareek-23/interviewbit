Softwired processor.
ISA 
H/w
RAM 2048*16-bit (user programme)
MDR,A is 16-bit registers
PC , MAR 11-bit registers

 Following NOt shown, control signals (E,L,I etc) ,IN/OUT flags (R, W)and external Interrfupt F)

In Animation(pdf file)
orange colour  lines shows the fetch (setting up contyrol signals)
green colour  lines shows the execution of current instruction (transfer of bits)
selcted block in thick bounded box, (in RAM it is green colour:  address and information)

Microinstructions of the selected instructions are shown in magenta backgrounded box)
left side is the address of RAM in black colour and right side micro control signals as per format.

Purpled background box shows the ROM and  microinstructions of instruction blocks 
 (few are shown BUN , BSA ,indirect tech etc)

sheets 1-8 - fetch cycle (no interrupt pending, F=0)
sheets 9-14 cycles (BSA direct, I=0, external interrupt F sets )
sheets 15-16 fetch cycle (interrupt bit F=1 interrupt set)
sheets 17-24 interrupt handling micro instructions
sheets 25-30 fetch cycle (left over fetch cycles)
sheets 31-34 BUN direct micro instructions
sheets 35-42  fetch cycle (no interrupt pending)
sheets 43-52 BUN indirect(I=1) micro instructions (46- to for indirect function)
sheets 53-58  fetch cycle (no interrupt pending)
